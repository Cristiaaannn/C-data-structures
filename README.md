# Principles of Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the principles of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is intended to function as a textbook for those embarking on the study of DSA, as well as a reference manual for professionals seeking to refresh their knowledge.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to elucidate the principles of DSA through clear, succinct explanations and practical examples. The code, written in C, spans a broad spectrum of topics, from fundamental data structures such as linked lists, to more intricate algorithms. This repository is a dynamic project, with additional topics to be incorporated over time.

This project is also a reflection of my personal perspective on DSA.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into distinct files, each addressing a specific topic in DSA. Here is a brief overview:

- `ll.c`: This file elucidates the principles of linked lists. It includes a function to initialize a linked list with a specified number of nodes, each with data input by the user. It also includes thread-safe operations, utilizing mutexes to prevent data races.
