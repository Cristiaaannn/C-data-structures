# Data Structures and Algorithms Principles

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), authored by Cristian Mirea. This repository is designed to serve as both a course textbook for those learning DSA, and a handy cheat sheet for professionals needing a quick refresher.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to demystify DSA by providing clear, concise explanations and practical examples. The code is written in C, and covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental data structures like linked lists, to more complex algorithms. The repository is a work in progress, with more topics to be added over time.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different files, each covering a specific topic in DSA. Here's a brief overview of what you can find:

- `ll.c`: This file demonstrates the principles of linked lists. It includes a function to initialize a linked list with a specified number of nodes, each with data input by the user. It also includes thread-safe operations, using mutexes to prevent data races.

## How to Use

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and browse through the `.c` files. Each file is a standalone program that demonstrates a specific DSA principle. You can compile and run the programs using any C compiler.
