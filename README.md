# Data Structures and Algorithms Principles

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed to be both a course textbook and a cheat sheet for quick reference at work.

## About

The project is authored by Cristian Mirea and aims to provide clear, concise explanations and examples of various DSA principles. The code is written in C and covers a wide range of topics, from basic data structures like linked lists, to more complex algorithms.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different files, each covering a specific topic in DSA. Here are some of the topics covered:

- Linked Lists (`ll.c`)

More topics will be added over time.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone it and browse through the `.c` files. Each file contains a standalone program that demonstrates a specific DSA principle.
